Multi-format Copy-Paste Tool
Open Source Project | 2024

Developed an intuitive, web-based application that empowers users to seamlessly copy and paste multiple types of data—text, images, and PDF files—and export them collectively as a ZIP archive. This project was designed to simplify multi-format content handling for creators, researchers, and productivity-focused users.

Key Highlights:

💡 Cross-format Support: Enabled users to input and organize diverse data formats within a single interface, eliminating the need for multiple tools.

🧰 Client-side ZIP Generation: Implemented on-the-fly ZIP file creation using JavaScript and libraries like JSZip, ensuring fast downloads without server dependency.

🖼️ Drag-and-Drop + Clipboard APIs: Integrated HTML5 APIs for easy drag-and-drop functionality and clipboard-based input, enhancing overall UX.

📁 Dynamic File Structuring: Automatically organized pasted content into categorized folders (e.g., /text/, /images/, /pdfs/) before packaging.

🧪 Use Cases: Particularly useful for students, content creators, or users managing diverse research materials in one go.

Tech Stack:

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

Libraries: JSZip, FileSaver.js

APIs: Clipboard API, FileReader API, Drag-and-Drop API

This tool is open-source and actively maintained on GitHub. Future plans include integrating OCR for scanned PDFs and adding real-time previews of pasted content.
